Secure Message Communication
====================================================================

We formalized the proof of the UC security of secure message
communication (SMC) using a one-time pad that's agreed using
Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

* We first proved the security of Diffie-Hellman key exchange,
  reducing it to the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption for a
  constructed DDH adversary. This proof makes use of EasyCrypt's
  eager/lazy random sampling facilities, because, in the real and
  ideal functionalities, the DDH exponents are chosen in the middle of
  the functionalities' execution.

* We then use the security of Diffie-Hellman key exchange to prove the
  security of secure message communication using a one-time pad agreed
  by the parties using D-H key exchange. This involves proving an
  instance of the UC composition theorem, as well as making use of
  the transitivity of UC security.

Our goal in this case study was to test our EasyCrypt UC architecture,
illustrating how instances of UC's composition operation and theorem
may be formalized in EasyCrypt.

The proof is complete, giving us confidence that our EasyCrypt UC
architecture is sound. But there is much work to be done before
the method can scale-up to realistic protocols. Most importantly:

* Proving relationships between structurally dissimilar programs
  involved heavy use of manual symbolic program evaluation, guided by
  case analysis - essentially running programs using repeated
  applications of the EasyCrypt tactics `sp` (for pushing assignments
  into the precondition), `inline` (for inlining procedures) and
  `rcondt`/`rcondf` (for reducing conditionals/while loops for which
  the truth/falsity of their boolean expressions can be established).  There is
  a pressing need for better EasyCrypt support for symbolic
  evaluation.

* In our case study, we proved an instance of the UC Composition
  Theorem, via the definition of the composed environment and bridging
  lemmas. We are now generalizing this work, producing a generic
  version of these definitions/proofs.  To obtain needed instances of
  the composition theorem, weâ€™ll then instantiate the generic
  definitions/proofs, and automatically generate some additional
  bridging definitions and proofs.

* Writing functionalities, simulators, etc., directly in EasyCrypt is
  somewhat tedious and error prone. We plan to develop a domain
  specific language for expressing functionalities, etc., with the
  short term goal of automatically translating DSL programs to actual
  EasyCrypt code.
